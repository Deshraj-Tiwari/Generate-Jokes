# Generate-Jokes
This is my first ever repository and I am using a random thing I made just to see how repositories are made. So, please do not rate my coding skills. I am a very beginner and I am very very new to Github as well. BTW, this code generates a random joke out of an array of many jokes.
If you have tips to give me please make sure. I have started a course of learning full stack development and if you see something wrong in my repository or you face an error, inform me if it is possible. I do not even know how to write a README.md file because I am very new here. That's it BYE!!
